        <p style="font-size:30px;">Hello this is a paragraph using
        a thing in the internet language, I am using this, this is 
        random text, jesus was a man who lived and earth, he had 
        followers and was named the son of god, jesus is related
        to the jewish god but isnt a god to the jews because the 
        god for the jews is yet to come. Humans created stuff from
        obersving and experimenting and now we have have computers
        that are connected together to make the internet. Then 
        among the internet the software that runs on the internet
        is the web
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p style="font-size:20px;">
                This is smaller text under the bigger text but with
                space for whatever reason. The actual text is small
                because we set it smaller, we need a new rock and 
                roll jesus. 
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style="font-size:30px;">
        This is some code that I will put in just to make it seem 
        different. We gotta learn to run a bunch of new stuff
        <br/>
        <br/>
        for(int bruno = 0; bruno < aNumber; i++) <br/><br/>
        this is the rest of the text, we can continue to talk about
        jesus, jesus was not black, he was most likely brown since 
        he was from the middle east, I think sometime during the dark
        ages the idea of jesus turned white
        </p>
        <h1 style="color:blue;"> this is a blue heading as heading one</h1>
        <p style="color:black;">
        This is another style but in white, we wont talk about jesus 
        anymore. Jesus loves you and the good lord will speak to those
        who are messengers like jesus, they will have faith and use the 
        the good language of lord to spread the love all around. We must
        thank lord and those he chooses to spread the love and hope for
        all the human beings on this earth.
        </p>
