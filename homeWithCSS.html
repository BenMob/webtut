        <h2>this is number 2</h2>
        <h3>Mr. Loser was an understood man with mental issues</h3>
        <p>
            He often drank and ranted on the internet on hacking and virii forums<br/><br/>
            I do not really think he contributed to the server other than keeping the chat active
            which many who run servers think it is a good idea it keep it running. The shoutbox
            That may still be available somewhere.

            Trevor and Corey are from trailer park boys and they are picked on all the time
            as a joke in the show. It is pretty funny for the show and one left because they really
            were picking on him as stuff, the other one came back and is still in the show.

            This is the start of another part, this is webstuff, the front end part that everyone<br/><br/>
            sees, we will create a simple layout then a comment box that handles all information 
            maybe experiment with some types to make our page look cool<br/><br/>
